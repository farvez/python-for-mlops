## Day 1 – Python Basics for MLOps


- Core data types used in ML pipelines
- Control flow for validation logic
- Functions for reusable logic
- File handling for configs, metrics, and data

### Why this matters in MLOps
- Pipelines rely on Python scripts, not notebooks
- Data, configs, and metrics are file-driven
- Clean scripting is required before ML frameworks

### How to run
python practice.py
